Fernbot for the JennSt-Onge discord.

To do:

- Cleanup inputs (maybe Pokemon, dogs, etc. should all use the same request line)
- Fix Pokemon (not all Pokemon have animations, should cascade through options)
- Add new features (C to F/F to C conversion would be nice, maybe some others)
- Fix stock quotes
- Allow weather to take Canadian postal codes and continue to allow American
- DONE: Add killswitch
